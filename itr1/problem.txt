when u click submit, the form submits (because of the submit button)
we need to take control of the form submission
eg.1. 
<form (ngSubmit) = "myOnSubmit()">

myOnSubmit(){
    console.log('submitted');
  }

THis code wont work without the following in app.module.ts:-
    import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';
    imports:[
    ...,
    FormsModule]
After u edit, then do ng serve. 

and now myOnSubmit() will be called.
